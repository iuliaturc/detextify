# Detextify
A Python library to remove unwanted pseudo-text from images generated by AI.

TODO: Add more context for why this is needed.

`Detextify` runs text detection on your image, masks the text boxes, and repeatedly in-paints the masked regions
until your image is text-free. `Detextify` can be run entirely on your local machine (using
[Paddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) for text detection and
[Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting) for in-painting), or call existing APIs
([Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) for text detection and
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) or [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) for in-painting).

## Installation
```commandline
pip install detextify
```

## Sample Usage
You can remove unwanted text from your image in only 2 lines:
```python
detextifier = Detextifier(TextDetector(), Inpainter())
detextifier.detextify("/my/input/image/path.png", "/my/output/image/path.png")
```
We provide multiple implementations for text detection and in-painting (both local and API-based), and you are also free to add your own.

### Text Detectors
1. `PaddleTextDetector` (based on [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)) runs locally.
2. `AzureTextDetector` calls an API from Microsoft Azure. You will first need to create a
[Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision) via the Azure
portal. Once created, take note of the endpoint and the key.
```python
AZURE_CV_ENDPOINT = "https://your-endpoint.cognitiveservices.azure.com"
AZURE_CV_KEY = "your-azure-key"
text_detector = AzureTextDetector(AZURE_CV_ENDPOINT, AZURE_CV_KEY)
```
Our evaluation shows that the two text detectors produce comparable results.

### In-painters
1. `DiffusersSDInpainter` (implemented via Huggingface's `diffusers` library) runs locally. Defaults to
[Stable Diffusion v2 for in-painting](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting).
2. `ReplicateInpainter` calls the [Replicate](https://replicate.com) API. Defaults to Stable Diffusion v2 for
in-painting (and requires  a key).
3. `DalleInpainter` calls the [DALLÂ·E 2](https://labs.openai.com) API from OpenAI (and requires a key).
```python
# You would instantiate only one of the following:
local_inpainter = DiffusersSDInpainter()
replicate_inpainter = ReplicateInpainter("your-replicate-key")
dalle_inpainter = DalleInpainter("your-openai-key")
```

## Contributing
To contribute, clone the repository, make your changes, commit and push to your clone, and submit a pull request.

To build the library, you need to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
```commandline
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
# Add poetry to your PATH. Note the specific path will differ depending on your system.
export PATH="/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:$PATH"
# Check the installation was successful:
poetry --version
```
Install dependencies for `detextify`:
```commandline
poetry install
```
To execute a script, run:
```commandline
poetry run python your_script.py
```
Please run the unit tests to make sure that your changes are not breaking the codebase:
```commandline
poetry run pytest
```
